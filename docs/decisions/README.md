This directory contains Agreed Decision Records (ADRs) for the hello-ai-coding project.

## Creating a new ADR

1. Copy [adr-template.md](adr-template.md) to a new file named `NNNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded sequence number).
2. Fill in the sections. Remove any optional sections that aren't relevant.
3. Add an entry to the index table above.
4. Open a pull request for team review.

[^1]: For background on the ADR practice, see [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/). Rather than only memorialize decisions about "architecture", the "A" in ADR is repurposed to widen the scope for decisions captured here without losing the link to the well-known acronym. This project follows the [MADR 4.0](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format.
